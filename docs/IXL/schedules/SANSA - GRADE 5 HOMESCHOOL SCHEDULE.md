## RESOURCES

### IXL Access Needed
- Math Grade 3, 4, 5 (for remediation ladder)
- English Language Arts Grade 5
- Science Grade 5

### Supplementary Materials
- Graph paper for geometry
- Ruler and protractor
- Journal for daily writing

## PARENT NOTES

1. **Transitions are Priority:** The writing block should consistently include transition practice until the trouble spot is cleared. This skill affects all writing.

2. **Geometry Takes Time:** The gap between 280 and grade-level (500) is significant. Be patient and celebrate small improvements.

3. **Build on Strengths:** Sansa's Number Sense (620) is strong. Use this confidence to tackle challenging problems.

4. **Reading and Writing Connection:** The reading skills directly support writing. Discuss how authors use transitions in the texts Sansa reads.

5. **Science Hands-On:** Whenever possible, add hands-on experiments to reinforce concepts (e.g., states of matter with ice/water/steam).

6. **Check-Ins:** Mid-week, ask Sansa to show you one thing she learned and one thing that was hard. Adjust as needed.

7. **Celebrate Progress:** Track the transitions SmartScore weekly. When it hits 80+, celebrate this specific achievement!
