## REMEDIATION TRACKING

### Geometry Gap Closure Progress

| Week | Focus Area | Target Skills | Goal |
|------|-----------|---------------|------|
| 1 | Area & Perimeter | Rectangles, triangles, parallelograms | Grade 5-6 mastery |
| 2 | Circles | Area, circumference, word problems | Grade 6-7 mastery |
| 3 | 3D Figures | Volume, surface area of prisms | Grade 7 mastery |
| 4 | Advanced 3D | Pyramids, cylinders, similar solids | Grade 8 introduction |

### Monthly Diagnostic Goals
- **Math Overall:** Move from 460-540 to 550+
- **Geometry:** Move from 330 to 450+
- **ELA:** Maintain 630-740, target 700+

---

## RESOURCES

### IXL Access Needed
- Math Grade 5, 6, 7, 8 (for remediation ladder)
- English Language Arts Grade 8
- Science Grade 8

### Supplementary Materials
- Graph paper for geometry
- Scientific calculator
- Journal for daily writing
- Access to credible online sources for research

---

## PARENT NOTES

1. **Remediation is Essential:** The second math block focuses on closing the geometry gap. This is not "going backward" - it's building the foundation needed for grade-level success.

2. **Monitor Frustration:** Grade 8 content may be challenging. If Lucas struggles, use IXL videos and allow more practice time.

3. **Celebrate Progress:** Track diagnostic improvements weekly. Even small gains in the geometry strand are victories.

4. **Independent Work:** At 13, Lucas should be able to work independently for portions of the day while you work with younger siblings.

5. **Real-World Connections:** Connect math to real life (cooking = fractions, building = geometry, shopping = percents).
