# Epic List

## Epic Overview

The AI-Powered Homeschooling Application is organized into four main epics that build progressively from basic infrastructure to advanced adaptive learning capabilities:

1. **Epic 1: Foundation & Assessment System:** Establish project infrastructure, user management, and initial assessment capabilities
2. **Epic 2: Core Learning Engine:** Implement ChatGPT integration, voice interaction, and basic lesson delivery
3. **Epic 3: Multimodal Assessment:** Add camera integration and work evaluation capabilities
4. **Epic 4: Adaptive Learning & Progress:** Implement progress tracking, adaptive curriculum, and parent integration

## Epic Progression Strategy

### Sequential Development Approach
Each epic builds upon the capabilities established in previous epics, ensuring that core functionality is solid before adding advanced features. This approach allows for early testing and validation of fundamental capabilities.

### MVP Scope
The first two epics constitute the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), providing basic AI tutoring with voice interaction. Epics 3 and 4 add advanced assessment and adaptive learning capabilities that differentiate the product in the market.

### User Value Delivery
Each epic delivers tangible value to users:
- **Epic 1:** Basic system usability and user management
- **Epic 2:** Core AI tutoring experience
- **Epic 3:** Multimodal learning assessment
- **Epic 4:** Personalized and family-integrated learning
