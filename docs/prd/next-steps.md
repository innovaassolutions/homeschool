# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
The PRD is complete with detailed user requirements and technical specifications. Please create a comprehensive UI/UX specification focusing on age-appropriate interfaces for children ages 5-13, voice interaction design patterns, camera integration workflows, and parent communication interfaces. Pay special attention to accessibility requirements and multimodal interaction design.

## Architect Prompt
The PRD provides complete functional and technical requirements for the AI-powered homeschooling application. Please create a comprehensive architecture document that addresses real-time voice processing, ChatGPT API integration with Actions, camera-based assessment workflows, user management across age groups, and scalable data storage for progress tracking. Consider the monorepo structure and ensure the architecture supports both current MVP needs and future commercial scaling.
